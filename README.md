# Tidy Tuesday

A repository dedicated to collecting and sharing the code and visualizations that I create as a part of the Tidy Tuesday challenge. From the R for Data Science Page, Tidy Tuesday is: 

"A weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. As this project was borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, an emphasis was placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem. However, any code-based methodology is welcome - just please remember to share the code used to generate the results."

To further increase my skills in R, the tidyverse packages, data manipulation, and data visualization, I'll be working through the Tidy Tuesday challenges in 2020! I'm excited to take this step and I'm hoping to not fall too far behind.
